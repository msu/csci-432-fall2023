# Advanced Algorithms (CSCI 432)

This repository is for class materials for CSCI 432 in Fall 2022, taught by Prof. Fasy.


## Description

MSU Course Catalog Description: 

A rigorous examination of advanced
algorithms and data structures. Topics include average case analysis,
probabilistic algorithms, advanced graph problems and theory, distributed and
parallel programming.

From the Instructor: 
```
This course is NOT a programming class, and is not
structured like the 132 and 232 courses that precede it.  In this course, we will
do many proofs (especially using induction), and will be writing pseudo-code, not
code.
```
## Prerequisites

* CSCI 246 (Discrete) or M 242 (Methods of Proof)
* CSCI 232 (Data Structures and Algorithms)

In particular, a student enrolled in CSCI 432
should be familiar with: 

* sorting and searching algorithms
* big-O notation, 
* basic recurrence relations,
* heaps, queues, lists, and hash tables
* proof by induction and by contradiction
* discrete probability.
